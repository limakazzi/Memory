# Memory

So this is my solution of coding task for Motorola Solutions. I tried to implement all the functionalities and write clean code as best as I can.
Developing this app was frustrating at times but very encouraging, I'm sure it allowed me to increase my skills, even though this code can definitely be improved.
For me, this is the essence of programming - finding solutions and expand skills. Currently, I treat it as a hobby but I want to do it professionally.
